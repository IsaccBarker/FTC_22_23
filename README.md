# Pregame Code Repository!

Hello! This is the repository for the code we write before we actually start working on the real competition code.
I'm purposely not listing build instructions here because y'all are probably gonna use the GUI, and if you aren't,
you already know how.

However, on the first time, please run the script at `./scripts/submodule.sh`. Gradle should `theoretically` pull
down the submodules, but don't count on it.
